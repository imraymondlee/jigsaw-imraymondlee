      <p>Iâ€™m Raymond Lee, a web developer from Vancouver, Canada. Graduating from Simon Fraser University with my Bachelor of Science and Business Minor, I have a diverse skill set that I hope to use in projects. My experience includes working in <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and <strong>marketing</strong>. My goal and passion is to make the web a more accessible place through my work. In my free time, you can find me learning and playing with new technology.</p>
